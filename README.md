# AI-Enhanced Periodic Table Visualization
## What‚Äôs This About?
This project is looking at the periodic table in a new perspective. Instead of a standard list of elements, I am using AI to fill in missing atomic properties, standardizes the data, and generates detailed visualizations with a pastel color scheme.
## Why It's Valuable
- Fixes missing data with AI (KNN Imputation)
- Makes atomic data easier to analyze
- Visualizes key properties using structured plots
- Generates an interactive 3D scatter plot for deeper insights
## How to Use It
1. Install the required libraries:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```
2. Run the script to create and visualize the periodic table:
```sh
python advanced_periodic_visuals.py
```
3. Review the generated data and visualizations.
## What You Get
- A bar plot of atomic weights
- A 3D scatter plot of atomic properties

### **Wine Dataset Visualizations: Rustic Matte Edition**
This project provides a **visually stunning and interactive exploration** of the **Wine Dataset** using Python. The visualizations are designed with a **rustic matte color palette**, inspired by fall and earthy tones, to create beautiful and easy-to-read graphs. The code leverages **Plotly** and **Matplotlib** to generate advanced, interactive visualizations that showcase the dataset's key features.

---

### **Key Features**
1. **Rustic Matte Color Palette**:
   - Medium purple, squash blue, sage green, tangerine, rusty brown, and deep teal.
   - Designed for clarity and aesthetic appeal.

2. **Interactive Visualizations**:
   - **Parallel Coordinates Plot**: Explore multidimensional relationships between features.
   - **3D Scatter Plot**: Visualize relationships between three features in 3D space.
   - **Heatmap**: Analyze feature correlations with a color-coded matrix.
   - **Pairplot**: Discover pairwise relationships between features.
   - **Stacked Bar Chart**: Compare mean feature values across wine classes.

3. **Advanced Techniques**:
   - Dynamic updates and hover interactions.
   - Customizable layouts and themes.

4. **Ease of Use**:
   - Standalone script with no external dependencies (other than Python libraries).
   - Graphs open in your web browser for seamless interaction.

---

### **How to Use**
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install plotly pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   Save the code to a file (e.g., `wine_visualizations_rustic.py`) and run it:
   ```bash
   python wine_visualizations_rustic.py
   ```

3. **Explore the Visualizations**:
   - The Plotly graphs will open in your default web browser.
   - The Matplotlib graphs will open in a separate window.

### **California Housing Market Analysis: A Comprehensive Exploration**
This project looks into the California Housing Dataset, providing a detailed and creative analysis of the housing market. Using advanced machine learning techniques, geospatial mapping, and interactive visualizations, the goal is to uncover key insights into the factors influencing housing prices in California.
---
#### **1. Dataset Overview**
The dataset includes features such as:
- **Median Income**: Average income of households in a block.
- **House Age**: Median age of houses in a block.
- **AveRooms**: Average number of rooms per household.
- **AveBedrms**: Average number of bedrooms per household.
- **Population**: Total population in a block.
- **AveOccup**: Average number of household members.
- **Latitude** and **Longitude**: Geographic coordinates of the block.
- **MedHouseVal**: Median house value for households in a block (target variable).
---
#### **2. Key Analysis Steps**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized distributions, correlations, and relationships between features.
   - Used rustic color palettes for aesthetic and thematic consistency.
2. **Geospatial Analysis**:
   - Mapped housing prices across California using `folium` and `HeatMap`.
   - Analyzed proximity to the coast and its impact on housing prices.
3. **Regression Analysis**:
   - Applied polynomial regression to capture non-linear relationships.
   - Evaluated model performance using mean squared error (MSE).
4. **Interactive Visualizations**:
   - Created interactive dashboards using `dash` for dynamic exploration of the dataset.
   - Used `plotly` for interactive scatterplots and pairplots.
5. **Advanced Techniques**:
   - Binned continuous variables for better visualization and interpretation.
   - Created custom continuous colormaps for gradient-based visualizations.
---
#### **3. Key Findings**
1. **Proximity to Water**:
   - Houses closer to the coast tend to have higher median values.
   - Distance to the coast is a significant predictor of housing prices.
2. **Geospatial Patterns**:
   - Housing prices are highly clustered around urban areas like Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   - Rural areas generally have lower median house values.
3. **Polynomial Regression**:
   - Adding polynomial features improved the model‚Äôs predictive power.
   - Non-linear relationships between features and house values were effectively captured.
4. **Interactive Insights**:
   - Interactive maps and dashboards provided deeper insights into spatial trends and feature relationships.
