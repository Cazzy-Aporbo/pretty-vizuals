# AI-Enhanced Periodic Table Visualization

## What‚Äôs This About?
This project is looking at the periodic table in a new perspective. Instead of a standard list of elements, I am using AI to fill in missing atomic properties, standardizes the data, and generates detailed visualizations with a pastel color scheme.

## Why It's Valuable
- Fixes missing data with AI (KNN Imputation)
- Makes atomic data easier to analyze
- Visualizes key properties using structured plots
- Generates an interactive 3D scatter plot for deeper insights

## How to Use It
1. Install the required libraries:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```
2. Run the script to create and visualize the periodic table:
```sh
python advanced_periodic_visuals.py
```
3. Review the generated data and visualizations.

## What You Get
- A bar plot of atomic weights
- A 3D scatter plot of atomic properties

### **Wine Dataset Visualizations: Rustic Matte Edition**

This project provides a **visually stunning and interactive exploration** of the **Wine Dataset** using Python. The visualizations are designed with a **rustic matte color palette**, inspired by fall and earthy tones, to create beautiful and easy-to-read graphs. The code leverages **Plotly** and **Matplotlib** to generate advanced, interactive visualizations that showcase the dataset's key features.

---

### **Key Features**
1. **Rustic Matte Color Palette**:
   - Medium purple, squash blue, sage green, tangerine, rusty brown, and deep teal.
   - Designed for clarity and aesthetic appeal.

2. **Interactive Visualizations**:
   - **Parallel Coordinates Plot**: Explore multidimensional relationships between features.
   - **3D Scatter Plot**: Visualize relationships between three features in 3D space.
   - **Heatmap**: Analyze feature correlations with a color-coded matrix.
   - **Pairplot**: Discover pairwise relationships between features.
   - **Stacked Bar Chart**: Compare mean feature values across wine classes.

3. **Advanced Techniques**:
   - Dynamic updates and hover interactions.
   - Customizable layouts and themes.

4. **Ease of Use**:
   - Standalone script with no external dependencies (other than Python libraries).
   - Graphs open in your web browser for seamless interaction.

---

### **How to Use**
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install plotly pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   Save the code to a file (e.g., `wine_visualizations_rustic.py`) and run it:
   ```bash
   python wine_visualizations_rustic.py
   ```

3. **Explore the Visualizations**:
   - The Plotly graphs will open in your default web browser.
   - The Matplotlib graphs will open in a separate window.
