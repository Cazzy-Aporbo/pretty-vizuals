# AI-Enhanced Periodic Table Visualization

## What’s This About?
This project is looking at the periodic table in a new perspective. Instead of a standard list of elements, I am using AI to fill in missing atomic properties, standardizes the data, and generates detailed visualizations with a pastel color scheme.

## Why It's Valuable
- Fixes missing data with AI (KNN Imputation)
- Makes atomic data easier to analyze
- Visualizes key properties using structured plots
- Generates an interactive 3D scatter plot for deeper insights

## How to Use It
1. Install the required libraries:
```sh
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```
2. Run the script to create and visualize the periodic table:
```sh
python advanced_periodic_visuals.py
```
3. Review the generated data and visualizations.

## What You Get
- A bar plot of atomic weights
- A 3D scatter plot of atomic properties
